# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This is a webpage that allows the user to search for a city and see the current weather, as well as the five-day forecast for that city. The website fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API. It also accesses the current date using dayJS. As a coding student, making this project has served as valuable experience in calling APIs, as well as parsing and displaying the data it fetches.

## Usage
The dashboard can be used by either typing a city into the search bar and clicking the 'search' button, or clicking one of the preset city buttons. The page will then display the city name, an icon representing current weather conditions, as well as the temperature in fahrenheit, the wind in MPH, and the humidity in percentage. In the boxes below, it also displays the temperature, wind, and humidity for that city for each of the next five days. When the page is first loaded, it will display the current weather for Atlanta.
